<font size="8" color="00BCFF" face="Segoe UI Semibold">I love Izayoi Sakuya because she's the best girl in the world! I love her elegant personality, her adorable and beautiful appearance, and her cool power to manipulate time! At first I thought of her as a simple anime crush, but I soon realized that she was the love of my life! I'll make sure to marry this girl soon in the future!</font>
